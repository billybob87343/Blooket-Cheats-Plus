## Todo
- [ ] Bypass CSP (WIP)
- [ ] Auto Play (who really wants this?)

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Which script should I use to make a bookmarklet?</h3></summary>

You should use the scripts ending in ".min.js", as using the others will have errors due to formatting.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you give me infinite tokens / bypass daily limit / permanently give me blooks / change pack luck?</h3></summary>

No, these are things we would've already done if they were possible, they're managed on the backend of Blooket so we can't modify them
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Who made/got those custom blooks in the get more blooks hack?</h3></summary>

The majority of those blooks are from Blacket and Pixelit, the rest were made from iBlooket, applesaucy411 (Reddit), DDragonYT (Reddit), Cerulean_MC (Reddit), and gengarfromfnaf (Discord). Ploopit Blooks are coming soon! maybe triangulet... (slim chance)
</details>


<details><summary><h3>Can you make hacks for (game)</h3></summary>

I already have gimkit and kahoot hacks listed on my profile.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>Can you make more Battle Royale cheats</h3></summary>

Battle Royale is a gamemode that works almost entirely on the host's end. The only thing we have control over is answering questions.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>What's the difference between Chat and Lobbychat?</h3></summary>

Chat (By Yeahbread on Ego Menu) is an online chat that you can talk and send images to anyone, even if they're not on the same game. Lobbychat (by Cryptodude3) can chat with anyone if they're in the same game as you. You can talk to BlooketBot users with Lobbychat as well. Aside from chatting Lobbychat can also execute commands. Here is a list:

### Commands
* set gold: /setstate gold:val
* set crypto /setstate crypto:val
* list all values to set: /dumpstate
* freeze frenzy scoreboard: /setval f/t t
* crash gold: /setval g/t t
* crash crypto: /setval cr/t t
* crash dino: /setval f/t t
* crash pirate: /setval d/t t
* freeze gold scoreboard: /setval tat/t t
* crash defense2(may take a few tries): /setval d/t t
* crash monster brawl: /setval xp/t t
* set gold to inf: /setval g Infinity
* just do /help for the rest
## Run while in lobby or in game, not before, not on nickname screen, INGAME!

<details><summary><h3>What happend to Minesraft2?</h3></summary>

Minesraft2 was sent a cease and desist from Blooket, and 05konz offered to take over since he wouldn't be able to.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>How do I do this on mobile?</h3></summary>

These scripts aren't made for mobile, so we don't really know how to get them to work on it.
</details>

<details><summary><h3>What's the Mobile GUI?</h3></summary>

The mobile GUI is the first GUI Minesraft2 ever made. Some people said it worked on mobile and it's a lot neater for mobile use apparently so we just called it that.
